# Overview

Here's where you'll find all the documentation for the whole process of getting up and running with Mina.

## What is Mina?

Mina is the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain. Current cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum store hundreds of gigabytes of data, and as time goes on, their blockchains will only increase in size. With Mina however, no matter how much the usage grows, the blockchain always stays the same size - about ~20 kilobytes (the size of a few tweets). This means Mina can be accessed trustlessly from any device, including phones and browsers, and enables frictionless integration of cryptocurrency into applications for developers.
