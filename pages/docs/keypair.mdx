# Generating a Keypair

In order to fully participate in the Mina network, the first step is to generate a Keypair, which consists of a Public Key and a Private Key. 

<Alert>

If you have previously created a keypair, you can re-use the previous keypair and skip ahead to [connect to the network](/docs/connecting).

</Alert>

## Installation

To simplify the process of creating a keypair, we've created a simple command-line utility called `mina-generate-keypair`. Follow the instructions bellow to install the tool onto your system.

### macOS

Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install minaprotocol/mina/mina-generate-keypair
```

You can now run `mina-generate-keypair -version` to check that the installation completed successfully.

### Debian 18.04 / Debian 9

After [adding the Mina repo](http://localhost:8000/docs/getting-started#ubuntu-1804--debian-9) you can simply run the following command.

```
sudo apt-get install mina-generate-keypair
```

You can run `mina-generate-keypair -version` to check that the installation completed successfully.

## Usage

Creating a keypair is simple and is accomplished in a few short steps.

First make sure you have a folder on your system where you can store the key files. We recommend using the `~/keys` folder.

```
mkdir ~/keys
```

Next, ensure the permissions are set properly this folder, this prevents unwanted processes from accessing these files.

```
chmod 700 ~/keys
```

Now we can generate our keys using the `mina-generate-keypair` command. You will be prompted to provide a password for the new keypair. <em>Do NOT forget this password.</em> 

```
mina-generate-keypair -privkey-path ~/keys/my-wallet`
```

This will create two files on your system, `~/keys/my-wallet` which contains the encrypted private key and `~/keys/my-wallet.pub` which contains the public key in plain text. Please store the password you used in a secure place, such as a password manager.

## Submit your Public Key

In the days leading up to a Testnet, we will begin collecting public keys from the community for Staking Signups. To see your public key use the following command:

```
cat ~/keys/my-wallet.pub
```

Copy the output of the command and submit it to the [Staking Signup](http://bit.ly/StakingSignup) form along with your Discord username.

## Next

Now that we have created our keypair, we can finally [connect to the network](/docs/connecting)!
