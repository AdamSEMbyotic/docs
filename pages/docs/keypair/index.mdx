# Generating a Keypair

In order to create a keypair for Mainnet or to fully participate in a Mina test network, the first step is to generate a Keypair, which consists of a Public Key and a Private Key. Currently there are two supported tools for generating keypairs mina-generate-keypair and ledger-app-mina. We also have a tool for validating that your private key is created properly.

Note that you may want to generate more than one keypair. For example, if you'd like to run a block producer most securely, you'll want a [hot wallet / cold wallet block production setup](/docs/hot-cold-block-production).

<br />

## mina-generate-keypair

We've created a simple command-line utility called `mina-generate-keypair`. Please see our [mina-generate-keypair documentation](/docs/keypair/mina-generate-keypair) to get started with installing and using the tool to generate your Keypair.

## ledger-app-mina 

You can use your [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet to securely store your Mina private keys. We are in the process of an independent security audit which currently has found no vulnerabilities, and development is nearly completed. Please see our [ledger-app-mina documentation](/docs/keypair/ledger-app-mina) to get started with this tool.

Note: We are still iterating a bit on this process, so check back here every few days for updates!

<Alert kind="warning">

Never give out your private key and make sure they are stored safely. If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and will lose your account funds. Always give out your public keys instead. Mina will never ask you for your private keys.

</Alert>

## Next steps

Now that we have created our keypair, we can finally [connect to the network](/docs/connecting) or share your public key.
