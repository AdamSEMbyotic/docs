# Generating a Keypair


In order to fully participate in the Mina network, the first step is to generate a Keypair, which consists of a Public Key and a Private Key. Currently there are several ways to generate a Keypair, firstly being the mina-generate-keypair tool and secondly the ledger-app-mina tool.

<Alert>

If you have previously created a keypair after Testnet 3.2b (public key should begin with `B62...`), you can re-use the previous keypair and skip ahead to [connect to the network](/docs/connecting).

## mina-generate-keypair

To simplify the process of creating a keypair, we've created a simple command-line utility called `mina-generate-keypair`. Please see our [mina-generate-keypair documentation](/docs/keypair/mina-generate-keypair) to get started with installing and using the tool to generate your Keypair. We recommend this method for now as the `ledger-app-mina` tool is still under development.

## ledger-app-mina 

A Mina app for the [Nano S/X hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/) being developed currently and supports creating a Keypair as well. Please see our [ledger-app-mina documentation](/docs/keypair/ledger-app-mina) to get started with this tool.

<Alert kind="warning">

Never give out your private key and make sure they are stored safely. If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and will lose your account funds. Always give out your public keys instead.

</Alert>

## Connecting to the network 

Now that we have created our keypair, we can finally [connect to the network](/docs/connecting)!
