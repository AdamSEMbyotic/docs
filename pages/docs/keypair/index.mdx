# Generating a Keypair


In order to create a keypair for Mainnet or to fully participate in a Mina test network, the first step is to generate a Keypair, which consists of a Public Key and a Private Key. Currently there are two supported tools for generating keypairs mina-generate-keypair and ledger-app-mina.

<br />

## mina-generate-keypair

We've created a simple command-line utility called `mina-generate-keypair`. Please see our [mina-generate-keypair documentation](/docs/keypair/mina-generate-keypair) to get started with installing and using the tool to generate your Keypair.

## ledger-app-mina 

You can use your [Ledger Nano X or Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet to securely store your Mina private keys. We are currently wrapping up a security audit which has found no vulnerabilities, otherwise development is nearly completed. Please see our [ledger-app-mina documentation](/docs/keypair/ledger-app-mina) to get started with this tool.

<br />

<Alert kind="warning">

Never give out your private key and make sure they are stored safely. If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and will lose your account funds. Always give out your public keys instead. Mina will never ask you for your private keys.

</Alert>

## Next steps

Now that we have created our keypair, we can finally [connect to the network](/docs/connecting) or share your public key.
