# Time-locked accounts

A time-lock prevents an account from spending funds for specified period of time or block height.

To createa  time-lock, you must provide the configuration when creating a new account. This can happen in the genesis ledger at the beginning of a network, or when creating a new account. In this section, we'll explore how to interact with a time-locked account and see how to create one ourselves.

<Alert>

  For the current release, values for time-locked accounts were assigned based on the order in which you signed up.

## Understanding time-locks

A time-lock consists of the following fields `initial_minimum_balance`, `cliff` time, a `vesting_period` time, and a `vesting_increment`.

You can still use an account if it has a time-lock, as long as the account holds enough funds. The amount of funds that are time-locked starts off as `initial_minimum_balance` at the beginning of the network. Once the network reaches a block height equal to the `cliff`, the time-locked amount begins to decrease by the `vesting_increment` amount every `vesting_period`.

For a more technical explanaition of this process, please see [RFC-0025](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/rfcs/0025-time-locked-accounts.md) which has a more in-depth overview.

### Supercharged Rewards

Along with time-locked accounts, we have introduced the notion of supercharged rewards. Once an account has no funds under time-lock (either a new account or the entire `initial_minimum_balance` has been vested) the block rewards are increased by a factor of 2x.

## Creating a time-locked account

As of the current release, the only way to create a time-locked account is with the genesis ledger. In future releases we will add commands to `coda client` and the GraphQL API that will allow you to create a new time-locked account.
