# Connect to a Network

In this section, we will learn about connecting to a Mina network. Mina currently supports multiple networks so we will also explore which network you should connect to depending on your interests and objectives.

Please note that each network requires a specific version of the Mina client. This means that instructions for `Zenith` will be slightly different than `Devnet`

The best place to start exploring Mina depends on your interests and objectives:

## Connect to Zenith

We recommend users connect to [Zenith](./connecting/connecting-zenith). `Zenith` is the production Mina network that users can connect to and immediately start running a node.

## Connect to Devnet

[Devnet](./connecting/connecting-devnet) is a network dedicated for those who want to develop and build with Mina. With `Devnet`, you can get access to liquid tokens to help build and test your applications.
`Devnet`uses the same genesis ledger as Testworld. Developers can reach out on Discord if they would like to request a prefunded account.
