# Logging

Mina logs are located in the configuration directory located at `~/.coda-config`. This directory contains the following log files:

* `coda.log` - This file contains the latest logs of the daemon. Each log file is limited to 10 Mebibyte (MiB) in size and rotates over 50 log files. Rotated log files are named `coda.log.x` from `coda.log.0` to `coda.log.50`
* `mina-best-tip.log` - This file contains the best tip logs of the daemon. This file makes it easier to collect the required logs from nodes to determine the best state for any hard fork. This file is limited to 5 Mebibyte (MiB) in size and rotates over a single log file `mina-best-tip.log.0`.
* `coda-prover.log` - This file contains logs for the prover's memory usage and batch sizes. It is limited to 128 Mebibyte (MiB) and rotates over a single log file.
* `coda-verifier.log` - This file contains logs for the verifier's memory usage and batch sizes. It is limited to 128 Mebibyte (MiB) and rotates over a single log file.

### Log levels:

The Mina daemon logs at the following levels, in this order of precedence:

* Spam
* Trace
* Debug
* Info
* Warn
* Error
* Fatal

<Alert>

Specifying a `log-level` of `Info` will only display messages from that log level and above and significantly reduce the logs' verbosity.

</Alert>

### Log format:

The format of the logs is defined by the folowing structure:

```
{
  "timestamp": timestamp,
  "level": level,
  "source": {
    "module": string,
    "location": string
  },
  "message": format_string,
  "metadata": {{...}}
}
```

### Exporting logs:

The Mina daemon provides a CLI helper to compress and package up the available log files from a node. 

For a running daemon, run `coda client export-logs` where you can pass an optional flag `-tarfile` to specify the tar archive's filename, which defaults to the current date-time. This command compresses the available logs and exports them to the `exported_logs` directory in the `~/.coda-config` directory.

<Alert>

The logs may be exported from a running node via GraphQL using the `exportLogs` [mutation](https://minaprotocol.com/docs/developers/graphql-api#mutations).

</Alert>

To export logs from a node that is not running, run the `coda client export-local-logs` command to compress the available local log files. Pass the `tarfile` option to specify the tar archive's filename, and the logs will be compressed and exported to the `exported_logs` directory in the `~/.coda-config` directory.

<Alert>

When creating or updating an issue on GitHub, you can upload the exported `tar.gz` file directly to the [issue](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues).

</Alert>

### Logging options:

The following options may be set when starting the daemon to customize the logging behaviour:

* `file-log-level` - log level for the log file (default: Trace)
* `log-level` - log level for output to the terminal via stdout (default: Info)
* `log-json` - print log output as JSON (default: plain text)
* `log-block-creation` - log the steps involved in including transactions and snark work in a block (default: true)
* `-log-received-blocks` - log blocks received from peers (default: false)
* `-log-snark-work-gossip` - log snark-pool diffs received from peers (default: false)
* `-log-txn-pool-gossip` - log transaction-pool diffs received from peers (default: false)
* `-log-precomputed-blocks` - include precomputed blocks in the logs (default: false)

### Crash Reports:

If the daemon crashes and is able, it will generate a crash report. Only the latest crash report will be retained, with the filename indicating the date-time of the crash, and the compressed file being exported to the `~/.coda-config` directory. You can upload this crash report to any [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues) to identify new issues and aid in debugging.

The crash report will contain some, or all of, the following log files:

* `crash_summary.json` - contains a summary of the crash, including the system info, the version information, and the final log output.
* `coda_status.json` - an output of the `coda client status` command for a summary of the daemon's final state.
* `coda_short.log` - contains the last 4MiB of the `coda.log` file.
* `registered_mask.dot` - contains the latest ledger visualization.
* `frontier.dot` - contains the latest frontier visualization.
* `daemon.json` - A copy of the daemon configuration file.
