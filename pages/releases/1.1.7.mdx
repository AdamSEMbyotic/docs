# Mainnet Stable Release 1.1.7

While hard at work on the 1.2.0+ releases, the O(1) Labs team discovered an issue with the transaction inclusion logic. In an abundance of caution, we have provided a stable fix on top of the existing 1.1.5 codebase, tagged as 1.1.7 to avoid any confusion with the previous 1.1.6alpha naming convention. The changes have been thoroughly tested, and are limited to the minimal change to prevent future issues. To run this same change on the 1.2.0 beta release version, see [1.2.0beta6](/releases/1.2.0beta6).
