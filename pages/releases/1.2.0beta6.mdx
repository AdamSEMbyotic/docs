# Mainnet Beta Release 1.2.0beta6

While working on stabilizing 1.2.0, the O(1) Labs team discovered an issue with the transaction inclusion logic. In an abundance of caution, we have provided this 1.2.0beta6 update to prevent larger issues, and the new logic has been thoroughly tested. Without this change, in rare circumstances any blocks or snark work your nodes produce may get rejected by the network.

To instead run this same change on the latest 1.1.5 stable version, see [Release 1.1.7](/releases/1.1.7).
